# CookieStore Simulation

This project is a Python-based simulation of a cookie store using threading and parallel computing concepts. The simulation models a cookie store process from taking orders to delivering them, highlighting the use of threads and parallelism.

## Features

- Simulation of a cookie store's order processing.
- Use of threading to model parallel processing of orders.
- Calculation of order processing time.
- Implementation of a simple pricing mechanism for each order.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher.
- Dependencies: `google_auth_oauthlib`, `google-auth-transport-requests`, `google-api-python-client`.

## Setup

To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Simulation

To run the simulation, use the following command:

```bash
python cookiestore.py
```

This will start the simulation and process the predefined orders.

## Project Structure

- `cookiestore.py`: Main file containing the simulation logic.
- `requirements.txt`: File listing all the dependencies.
